## Article I: Constitutional Foundation

### Section 1.1: Legal Authority Hierarchy
- **Primary Legal Architect:** Nnamdi Michael Okpala - Supreme Constitutional Authority

### Section 1.2: Core Constitutional Doctrine
> "Good behavior shall be rewarded through systematic progression and enhanced access. Harmful behavior shall be isolated through automated consequence enforcement and permanent exclusion protocols."

### Section 1.3: Machine-Verifiable Policy Implementation

**Policy Structure with GUID/UID Telemetry:**
```bash
# Core Policy Schema: Verb-Noun + GUID/UID + A*Scoring
#righttoact-{GUID}-{UID} @stakeholder @project_milestone
#qualityassurance-{GUID}-{UID} @deliverable @threshold_85_percent  
#noghosting-{GUID}-{UID} @investment @milestone_payment

# Policy Shuffle Severity Levels (0-12 scale):
# 0-3: OK/Warning (log(n) processing)
# 3-6: Warning→Critical (thread-safe batch processing)  
# 6-9: Danger→Critical (immediate PID fork spawn)
# 9-12: Critical→Panic (constitutional violation enforcement)
```
