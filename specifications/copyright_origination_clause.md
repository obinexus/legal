### OBINexus Copyright Origination Clause (Active vs Passive Use)

**Clause X – Content Origination and Copyright Eligibility**

1. **Definition of Roles:**
   - A party is considered an **Active Creator** when they *materially contribute to the formation, authorship, or structural expression* of intellectual property (IP), including but not limited to software, written work, design systems, or conceptual models within the OBINexus ecosystem.
   - A party is considered a **Passive User** when they *consume, observe, redistribute, or engage with content without demonstrable material contribution* to its creation.

2. **Rights and Ownership:**
   - Only **Active Creators** shall be granted copyright, licensing, or derivative rights over OBINexus intellectual property or content under the applicable laws governing creative works.
   - Passive Users **forfeit any copyright or legal ownership claims**, regardless of their interaction with or exposure to the intellectual material, unless express permission is granted in writing by the rightful Active Creator.

3. **Nullification of Claims:**
   - Any claim of copyright, authorship, or licensing by a Passive User is deemed **null and void** under OBINexus policy and shall not be recognized legally or contractually.

4. **Usage Restrictions:**
   - Passive Users are permitted only **non-exclusive, non-commercial, revocable access** to OBINexus-generated content unless bound by a separate, signed licensing agreement.

5. **Attribution and Disclosure:**
   - All parties engaging with OBINexus content must clearly disclose their role as either Active Creator or Passive User. Misrepresentation of role may result in legal or organizational sanctions.

**Tagline Version (for public-facing docs):**
> "If you didn't actively create it, you can't legally claim it."
>
> OBINexus defines *active creation* as the legal threshold for copyright and licensing.  
> Passive use ≠ ownership. All claims must originate from material contribution.
