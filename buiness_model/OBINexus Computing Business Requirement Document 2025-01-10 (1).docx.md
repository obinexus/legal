1. Introduction:  
   1. Objective)  
      Problem Statement:  
      In traditional distributed networking system interaction, it is absurdly easy to misconfigure and introduce bugs into a concurrent system. These multithreaded concurrent systems used by intuitional services on a global scale are susceptible to malfunction due to the nature of concurrency, and multithreading application/programs.

      Above all, it must be consistent in both code convention, and practices, and authority regulation. In addition, external adversarial entities that intercept data over the internet remains a risk to **business operations**.

      A personal anecdote I have experienced is the use of my Sleep Aponia machine. When turned on, the machine starts breathing air into the patient mouth inflating the lungs. Simultaneously, it must provide real time data over the **internet securely** relying it to the doctors wherever on the globe.

      This multithreaded operation **must** remain consistent throughout the patient slumber. 

      In today technology sophisticated world, exploit with just a browse on the web can be introduced quickly into programs. These exploit plays a crucial role in the real world, as business reputation is run into ruins.

   On Safety Critical Systems 

      A safety-critical system such as my sleep aponia machine. A safety critical guideline adhering to good code principle(conventions) and practices is required. 

      From writing space-proof code to the implementing thread-safety on a sleep aponia machine. A safety critical system is a system where decoherence of data can happen at any given time. 

      Traditional efforts by NASA with minimum merits is the power of ten. Some programming languages do not directly align with the Power of Ten NASA Safety Critical Guideline/Rules. Therefore, this means in an unsupported language attempting to use the power of then introduces overhead in phases of development. The power of ten address some of these problems, not the majority. 

      What is a Thread Based Attack and Thread Safety?

      One sophisticated exploit is a thread-based exploit. Before we dive into Thread Based Exploit and Attacks. It is paramount to address the elephant in the room (Threads and Thread Safety).

       A thread is an independent subroutine â€“ a smaller unit of program that can run independently. Thread safety is the process of ensuring that a program correctly runs independently with the elephant being the validation of integrity state, and data of the program which should not decohere and interfere (corrupt) when the programs run (especially in production).

      Theoretically, how would thread-based attack work in todays world? 

      Take a simple traditional non threading web server, A server that serves request to a banking account. A bank account performing a multithreading operation.

      Such interaction with between the client(browser), and server carries a risk of race condition. A race condition will occur when two or more threads attempts to modify shared data at the same time. A significate impact is unexpected behaviour, corrupt programming and unauthorized access to the faulty system.

      

      For example, consider the following scenario in a porrly impelemented multi-threaded server.

      

      Theoretically, an adversarial on the Internet having intercepted a connection can perform malicious operation on the Sleep Aponia Machine, flipping a bit can cause the machine to malfunction unalive-Ing the patient.  A common solution to this problem is usage of locks, semaphores and mutexes, it requires careful processing of data in according to It type system. A type system validates a type of data units of information and it value it associated data.
