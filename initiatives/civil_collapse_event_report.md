## **Title**
**Critical Housing Sector Civil Collapse - Thurrock, Essex, United Kingdom**  
**Event Classification: Housing Abandonment & Resource Misallocation**  
**Severity: CRITICAL**  
**OBINexus Reference: documentation.tracking.obinexus.housing.reform.uk.org**

---

## **Summary**
This report documents a critical civil collapse event in Thurrock, Essex, wherein the Local Authority systematically failed to provide adequate housing support while simultaneously investing £700 million in speculative solar farm ventures. This constitutes a fundamental breach of statutory housing duties, resulting in functional homelessness for qualified residents, including those with disabilities and care-leaving status. The affected population includes vulnerable adults aged 18-24, persons with disabilities, and those transitioning from care systems. The collapse is characterized by bureaucratic abandonment, resource misallocation, and systematic denial of housing rights through weaponized capacity assessments.
