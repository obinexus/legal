## Framework Overview

### Mission Statement
OBINexus operates on the fundamental principle that technology and business practices must serve human dignity rather than exploit human resources. Our systematic approach to ethical business operations is built upon mathematical frameworks, formal verification, and waterfall development methodology.

### Core Principles
- **Truth Before Inference**: All business relationships require verification infrastructure before engagement
- **Systematic Documentation**: Every interaction must be documented and supported by legal framework
- **Human-Centered Design**: All implementations prioritize human experience and cultural sensitivity
- **No Black Box Doctrine**: System transparency enables accountability and reproducible verification

### Policy Hierarchy
1. **Tier 1 (Mandatory)**: #NoGhosting, Consumer-Customer Protocol
2. **Tier 2 (Standard)**: Milestone-Based Investment, Ethical Partnership Charter
3. **Tier 3 (Advanced)**: OpenSense Recruitment Framework

---

## #NoGhosting Business Policy

> **Base Policy**: Communication integrity forms the foundation of all OBINexus operations.

### Definition
Ghosting constitutes any professional engagement where communication ceases without notice or explanation after initial contact establishment. This includes but is not limited to:
- Interview processes without closure
- Partnership discussions without formal conclusion
- Project collaborations without status updates
- Business negotiations without transparent resolution

### Core Requirements

#### Communication Standards
- **Maximum Response Time**: 5 business days for initial acknowledgment
- **Status Update Frequency**: Weekly for active engagements, monthly for dormant projects
- **Closure Protocol**: Formal notification required for all engagement terminations

#### Structured Follow-Up Framework
```
Week 1: Initial engagement response required
Week 2: Status confirmation and next steps outlined
Week 3: Progress update or hold notification
Week 4: Formal continuation or termination decision
```

### Legal Recourse Mechanisms

#### Breach Documentation
All ghosting incidents must be documented with:
- Communication timestamps and channels
- Engagement context and expectations set
- Follow-up attempts with responses (or lack thereof)
- Impact assessment on project timelines

#### Cost Function Estimates
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ghosting-cost-calculator.sh
# Calculates productivity loss from communication lapses

ENGAGEMENT_HOURS=$1
HOURLY_RATE=$2
OPPORTUNITY_COST_MULTIPLIER=2.5

BASE_COST=$((ENGAGEMENT_HOURS * HOURLY_RATE))
TOTAL_IMPACT=$((BASE_COST * OPPORTUNITY_COST_MULTIPLIER))

echo "Ghosting Cost Analysis:"
echo "Direct Time Investment: £${BASE_COST}"
echo "Opportunity Cost Impact: £${TOTAL_IMPACT}"
echo "Documentation Required: Yes"
```

#### Enforcement Protocols
- **Public Documentation**: Maintain transparent record of ghosting incidents
- **Network Communication**: Share verified ghosting patterns with professional networks
- **Contractual Clauses**: Include anti-ghosting provisions in all formal agreements
- **Platform Reporting**: Submit verified incidents to professional review platforms

### Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Communication response time tracking system
- [ ] Automated follow-up scheduling
- [ ] Incident documentation templates
- [ ] Legal clause library for contracts
- [ ] Cost calculation automation
